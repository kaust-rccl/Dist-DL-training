# What is this Exercise About?

This exercise explores large language model (LLM) fine-tuning using DeepSpeed, a deep learning optimization library for large-scale training. The workshop walks through a practical progression:

1. Baseline fine-tuning using Hugging Face Trainer **without** DeepSpeed.

2. Fine-tuning on a single GPU using DeepSpeed with different ZeRO optimization stages.

3. Comparing ZeRO stages with and without CPU offloading.

4. Evaluating memory usage and performance trade-offs across configurations.

5. Scaling up to multi-GPU and multi-node training using DeepSpeed's distributed launcher.

## Why DeepSpeed?

Training such large models is computationally expensive and quickly runs into memory limits ‚Äî especially on a single GPU.

DeepSpeed is a deep learning optimization library from Microsoft designed to:

- **Reduce GPU memory usage** via ZeRO optimizations (stage 1‚Äì3).

- **Enable distributed training** across GPUs and even nodes.

- Support **model and tensor parallelism**.

- Work seamlessly with **Hugging Face Transformers**.

## Learning Outcomes

### By the end of this exercise, participants will be able to:

1. Understand the **basics of fine-tuning** transformer models **using Hugging Face and DeepSpeed**.

2. Configure DeepSpeed for **ZeRO Stage 1, 2, and 3**, with and without offloading.

3. Measure and interpret training **performance, memory footprint, and scalability** across setups.

4. Launch **distributed** training jobs on **multiple GPUs and across multiple nodes**.

# Baseline: BLOOM Fine-tuning without DeepSpeed:

## Fine-Tuning Setup

before exploring `DeepSpeed` optimizations, it‚Äôs useful to understand the vanilla `HuggingFace` fine-tuning process using a smaller LLM like `bigscience/bloom-560m`, and 500 examples subset of `SQuAD` for question-answer format training.

### Model Loader and Saver
[model.py](baseline/model.py) Defines two key functions:

1. `load_model()`: Loads `bigscience/bloom-560m` model and tokenizer.

2. `save_model()`: Saves the trained model and tokenizer to disk.

### Dataset Preprocessing

[data_loader.py](baseline/data_loader.py) Handles:

1. Loading the SQuAD dataset using Hugging Face datasets.

2. Tokenizing each example as:
    ```
    "Question: ... Context: ... Answer: ..."
    ```
3. Padding/truncating to max length (512).

4. Setting labels = input_ids (for causal LM).

5. Optionally subsetting the dataset for faster experiment.

### Training Configuration
[config.py](baseline/config.py) Centralizes hyperparameters makes tuning and experimenting easier ‚Äî change config values in one file without touching the training script.
This section defines the core training hyperparameters and behaviors using the Hugging Face 
- `output_dir`:`./bloom-qa-finetuned`	Directory to store model checkpoints, logs, and evaluation results.
- `eval_strategy`:`epoch`	Evaluation is run at the end of each training epoch.
- `save_strategy`:`epoch`	A model checkpoint is saved at the end of each training epoch.
- `per_device_train_batch_size`:`4`	Batch size to use on each GPU or each CPU worker during training.
- `per_device_eval_batch_size`:`4`	Batch size to use on each device during evaluation.
- `gradient_accumulation_steps`:`4`	Number of steps to accumulate gradients before performing a backward/update pass. Simulates a larger effective batch size.
- `num_train_epochs`:`3`	Total number of training epochs (full passes through the dataset).
- `learning_rate`:`5e-5`	Initial learning rate for the optimizer.
- `weight_decay`:`0.01`	Weight decay (L2 penalty) to apply for regularization. Helps prevent overfitting.
- `fp16`:`True`	Enables automatic mixed precision (AMP) training for reduced memory usage and faster computation (requires compatible hardware).
- `gradient_checkpointing`:`False`	Disables gradient checkpointing. If set to True, it reduces memory usage by trading off compute time.
- `push_to_hub`:`False`	Disables automatic pushing of the model and logs to the Hugging Face Hub. Set to True if you want to share your model publicly or privately.

### Training 
The [train.py]() script fine-tunes a causal language model (e.g., BLOOM) using Hugging Face's Trainer API.

**Hugging Face Trainer:**

The Trainer class from Hugging Face simplifies the process of training and evaluating models ‚Äî especially useful when working with transformers, tokenizers, and large datasets.
Instead of writing your own training loop with forward(), backward(), optimizer steps, and logging ‚Äî Trainer handles it for you.

**What Happens When You Call `trainer.train()`?**
- Batches the dataset using the data collator
- Moves data to GPU if available
- Runs model(input_ids) and computes the loss
- Applies backpropagation (loss.backward() + optimizer step)
- Saves checkpoints and logs progress
- Evaluates on the validation set (if provided)

### SLURM Job Submission Script

[baseline.slurm](baseline/baseline.slurm) is used to run the entire experiment on an HPC cluster.

**Key sections:**

- #SBATCH directives define resources: 1 GPU, 32GB RAM, 12 hours.

- Activates your Conda env and loads CUDA module.

- Starts nvidia-smi memory logging in the background.

- Executes python train.py.

- Kills memory logger afterward.

### Bringing It All Together: Running the Baseline Fine-Tuning Experiment

Once all components are in place ‚Äî model loading, dataset preprocessing, training configuration, and training logic ‚Äî you can execute the full fine-tuning workflow with minimal manual steps.

Use the baseline.slurm script to submit the training job on a GPU node:

```commandline
sbatch baseline.slurm
```
### Output Artifacts

After the run finishes, you'll find:

- Fine-tuned model and tokenizer in `./bloom-qa-finetuned/`

- Training logs including evaluation metrics and loss curves

- SLURM log files in the `logs` directory or as specified by --output

##  Exercise: Recreate the Baseline Training & Evaluation Summary Table

As part of this workshop, your task is to **run the baseline fine-tuning experiment** and **recreate the performance summary table** using your own training logs.

This exercise helps you develop a habit of tracking key metrics like training loss, evaluation loss, and throughput ‚Äî which are essential for understanding and debugging model training.


### Objective

After running `train.py`, fill in the following table with metrics from your output:

| **Metric**                      | **Your Value**           |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Train Loss (Final)              | _Fill from final output_  |
| Eval Loss (Epoch 1)             | _From evaluation logs_    |
| Eval Loss (Epoch 2)             | _From evaluation logs_    |
| Eval Loss (Epoch 3)             | _From evaluation logs_    |
| Training Speed (samples/sec)    | _Reported by Trainer_     |
| Evaluation Speed (samples/sec)  | _Reported by Trainer_     |
| Steps per Epoch                 | _From logs or config_     |



### üîç Where to Find These Values

- **Loss values** appear in the `.out` files located in `logs` directory , in lines containing `loss=` or `eval_loss=`.
- **Training and evaluation speed** are typically printed after evaluation steps or at the end of training.
